# 7500-unique-kana-images
I generated a bunch of pictures of Kana using handwritten fonts.
There are 56 images per each character. Each image is 100x100.
### File naming scheme
The file name properties are seperated with underscores, the properties are:
 1. character latin
 2. Font family name
 3. Bool if the character has any sort of dakuken
